This repository is part of my learning journey through Phil Let Code’s classes.

I’m still learning, and I won’t pretend I know everything yet — but I can honestly say I’m learning a lot. This repo represents practice, mistakes, progress, and consistency.

I started studying during a difficult moment in my life. Instead of letting anger and sadness stop me, I chose to use them as fuel — motivation to grow, improve my skills, and work toward changing my life.

This repository is not just about code.
It’s about discipline, resilience, and building something better, one step at a time.
