This repository is part of my learning journey through Phil Let Code’s classes.

I’m still learning, and I won’t pretend I know everything yet — but I can honestly say I’m learning a lot. This repo represents practice, mistakes, progress, and consistency.

I started studying during a difficult moment in my life. Instead of letting anger and sadness stop me, I chose to use them as fuel — motivation to grow, improve my skills, and work toward changing my life.

I’m also using this repository to test and improve my development workflow between macOS and Linux, making sure my projects remain consistent across different environments. This helps me better understand real-world development setups and avoid common cross-platform issues.

This repository is not just about code.
It’s about discipline, resilience, and building something better, one step at a time.
